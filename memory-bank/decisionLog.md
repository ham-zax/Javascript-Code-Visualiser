[2025-04-30 05:59:44] - Renamed `_handleVarWriteEvent` to `processVarWriteEventAndUpdateScopes` in `backend/src/main/storyReducer.js` for clarity on side effects. No functional change.
[2025-04-30 06:00:48] - Extracted the logic for handling 'Locals' events from the main switch statement in `storyReducer` into a new helper function `_processLocalsEvent` for improved modularity and readability.
[2025-04-30 06:03:30] - Extracted the logic for handling 'Closure' events from the main switch statement in `storyReducer` into a new helper function `_processClosureEvent` for improved modularity and maintainability.
[2025-04-30 06:04:07] - Extracted the logic for handling 'ConsoleLog', 'ConsoleWarn', and 'ConsoleError' events from the main switch statement in `storyReducer` into a new helper function `_processConsoleEvent` for improved clarity and reduced repetition.
